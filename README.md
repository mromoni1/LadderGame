# LadderGame
This is my first ever project using object-oriented design! I was inspired to create this game after playing Weaver online, which is a game 
where you have to connect two, four-letter words by only changing one letter at a time and making each consecutive word a real word! 

I coded this project in Java and created graphics using JavaSwing during the summer of 2022.
